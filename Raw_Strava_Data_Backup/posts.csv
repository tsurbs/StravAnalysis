"Mar 19, 2022, 9:14:00 PM","""Stress fracture suspected""","Sooooo yeah I went to the doctor yesterday and they did an x-ray and on that x-ray, there's a little nub on my second metatarsal that apparently means I have a stress fracture bc my foot is trying to heal there.  Doctor said 2-3 months is the usual amount of time before ppl with this kind of injury can train again so that's pretty much track season right there.  MRI on Monday to confirm, meeting with doctor again on Tuesday.  Overall very glad to have gotten an appointment on such short notice and the doctor seems very good so that's all good.  Now I'm wearing a hard-soled sandal thing except when I'm sleeping. Planning on swimming to keep up the fitness but I'll be sad to lose running for its unique mental stimulation and of course the competition and social aspects.  Hoping for the best with this MRI, but regardless running was always about more than just seasons and hopefully after this I'll be able to run for the rest of my life.  Also I was thinking about it and I'm not sure I know many people if anybody who is older than me and still running who hasn't had a stress fracture sooo maybe I should just be happy this didn't happen sooner idk ergh.","",""
