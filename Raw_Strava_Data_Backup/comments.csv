"Aug 2, 2019, 2:45:58 AM","Not much time, so I incorporated - striders +footdrills into middle of run, on flat road.  Moderately hot, 79, just ate dinner, no stretch before, after."
"Aug 7, 2019, 3:48:22 AM",Ran after dinner and was fine for the first mile but then I got massive painful cramps in abdomen.  These persisted for the rest of the run.  Also I did 6 striders+footdrills after cramps subsided.
"May 27, 2020, 12:39:11 PM",I wasn't sure if it was ppl who ran at wips or just ppl who ran in the wpial district thing -- if anyone knows for sure plz lmk
"Jun 7, 2020, 8:46:51 PM",Idk Abt a morning long run lol
"Jun 7, 2020, 8:47:24 PM",No problem... Not sure how that happened
"Jun 23, 2020, 2:13:09 PM",Yup
"Jun 26, 2020, 7:02:56 PM",Because I saw them in my feed and didn't want to forget to join them later lol
"Jul 6, 2020, 2:06:31 PM",Yeah just to keep my lr on Sunday
"Jul 16, 2020, 2:23:27 PM",Sad to see my record fall good job.
"Jul 21, 2020, 3:52:19 AM",Did u do the same workout as last week? (Also the PC looks good)
"Jul 25, 2020, 1:21:13 PM",Yeah lol good job noticing
"Aug 11, 2020, 1:50:36 PM",Lol I didn't even notice that. Ig it just shows u can't trust strava 
"Aug 17, 2020, 9:25:52 PM",Classic first o'hara run of the year workout
"Aug 18, 2020, 12:37:58 AM",Do I spot some lvl 1 hillz?
"Aug 19, 2020, 9:31:55 PM",5 on 1 off???  That's brutal... How's u get down the hill?
"Aug 20, 2020, 2:38:05 AM",Oh I see I thought this was hillz for some reason
"Aug 26, 2020, 12:42:30 AM",Haha thx u just gave me a reason to run nature reserve again
"Aug 27, 2020, 10:11:01 PM",I think the person who came behind me was like 5:20 and then the one after that was like 5:27.  Those numbers could be way off tho
"Aug 27, 2020, 11:37:57 PM",Oh those were their mile time trial times
"Sep 3, 2020, 9:37:00 PM",Lol nope
"Sep 3, 2020, 9:40:28 PM",I mean it kinda is with the stops
"Sep 4, 2020, 3:35:34 PM",At north park
"Sep 10, 2020, 12:56:15 AM","yeah really, now I have a high bar for my 5k time trial on Friday"
"Sep 15, 2020, 10:53:38 PM",Thx lol
"Sep 17, 2020, 9:49:39 PM",Just so there isn't a big jump in distance with no time change that would screw with the strava pace
"Sep 19, 2020, 11:11:37 PM",One more mile at this pace and you'd have done what Ethan did gg.
"Sep 23, 2020, 12:09:46 AM",Good job... Just try to beat my falconhurst exit time now(not a record but still)
"Sep 23, 2020, 12:42:35 AM",Yeah thats the best part of the Nature Reserve Loop
"Sep 25, 2020, 9:15:58 PM",Yeah good job.  I was gonna guess that yesterday but I didn't want to be wrong.
"Sep 29, 2020, 9:04:46 PM",Wait so you won't tell moul if I run a sub 18?
"Oct 7, 2020, 9:29:47 PM",Yeah ikr can't wait until corona has settled down so we can all run together again
"Oct 7, 2020, 9:56:18 PM",Dang nice!
"Oct 17, 2020, 7:27:55 PM",The world will never know
"Oct 17, 2020, 8:11:54 PM",No way!
"Oct 21, 2020, 11:35:53 PM",Ah man sorry üôÅ I forgot abt NA
"Oct 22, 2020, 3:53:07 PM",Owen should be in class confirmed
"Oct 22, 2020, 9:34:44 PM",Oof sorryüò§
"Oct 27, 2020, 7:35:10 PM",Yee
"Oct 27, 2020, 9:33:01 PM",Oof also it's single a so there are just fewer ppl and it was a rough course.  The first place person's pr is a 15:05 and they barely broke 19
"Oct 27, 2020, 9:52:38 PM",Yeah it was rough esp bc most of our courses aren't hilly at all
"Oct 28, 2020, 9:03:56 PM","Gg that was a good race, rough course"
"Oct 29, 2020, 10:36:35 PM",Those track segments are gonna be quick
"Oct 30, 2020, 9:30:00 PM",Sorry but congrats on a good race
"Oct 31, 2020, 1:05:22 PM",What even is that segment
"Nov 9, 2020, 11:21:01 PM",Nah idk how this was as fast as it was bc the first half was like 6:00 pace so...
"Dec 3, 2020, 10:11:35 PM",You should do ridc before giant eagle leaves FYI
"Dec 4, 2020, 2:36:25 PM",Lol fr I thought before coming here I wonder if owen left a comment on my run?  Jk I saw the notification
"Dec 9, 2020, 9:59:30 PM",Not sponsored by nike?
"Dec 12, 2020, 1:02:00 AM",After that casual 6:38 I thought I'd be slowing you down at 7:00!
"Dec 21, 2020, 12:47:47 PM",Nah couldn't sleep lol
"Dec 29, 2020, 3:02:41 PM",Lol it was literally the only picture I could find where my mouth wasn't weird.
"Dec 29, 2020, 3:05:53 PM",Also Owen  Carter u looking like an absolute unit with your profile pic.
"Dec 30, 2020, 1:17:25 AM",*too? Also didn't you just get snow a couple of days ago?
"Dec 30, 2020, 9:16:57 PM",Lol definitely a better hill runner than me! 
"Jan 5, 2021, 12:42:23 AM",Yup that's what I'm tryna avoid here
"Jan 6, 2021, 11:42:05 PM",Indeed that's how I got to 13 miles without going further than like 1.5 miles away
"Jan 7, 2021, 12:33:07 AM",RIDC just isn't the same without geese blocking the entire road.
"Jan 7, 2021, 8:57:04 PM",Win XC by more? We'll see about that..... 
"Jan 7, 2021, 9:37:23 PM",Lol hills are not my strong suit
"Jan 8, 2021, 12:30:07 AM",I congratulate you on realizing the error in your ways.  
"Jan 8, 2021, 12:31:44 AM","Also what is this ""All the way up"" segment and why haven't I tried it?"
"Jan 8, 2021, 12:33:01 AM",Geez I cant wait for corona be to over so I can come run with y'all.(sorry this is a lot of comments)
"Jan 8, 2021, 2:31:01 AM","As I am basically a cyclist myself after 4 days of cycling, I sympathize"
"Jan 9, 2021, 7:35:31 PM",PETA wants to know your location
"Jan 9, 2021, 7:40:36 PM","Too late, you seem to have posted your location on some small social media site for athletes known as strava"
"Jan 12, 2021, 8:32:54 PM",Lol around here 560 feet in elevation would be a hill workout
"Jan 12, 2021, 10:28:00 PM",Yeah I'm new to the sport!
"Jan 19, 2021, 10:09:09 PM","Yes, Dr. Phil's word is the law."
"Jan 19, 2021, 10:29:15 PM",The groundhog isn't a doctor?  I wonder how he stays alive so long then...
"Jan 20, 2021, 4:42:55 AM",Lol it was gonna happen at some point
"Jan 23, 2021, 5:08:03 PM",Owen  Carter 
"Feb 8, 2021, 10:21:31 PM",HahAhahAHaha. üò∂
"Feb 9, 2021, 6:56:09 PM",This route is very confusing to my powers-run-road-centric brain map
"Feb 9, 2021, 7:16:47 PM","Imagine not living in FC, couldn't be me"
"Feb 11, 2021, 8:42:05 PM",Who are you and what have you done with Owen Carter?
"Feb 11, 2021, 10:51:17 PM",Bruh why do u have a 4 day weekend? I do too but Ive got Monday and Tuesday off so I guess it's not a holiday?
"Feb 11, 2021, 10:55:13 PM",Ah makes sense lol
"Feb 12, 2021, 12:38:05 AM",Uhhhhhhh I think they're calling it a mid-winter break so I'm guessing there's no good reason.
"Feb 12, 2021, 12:40:23 AM",Nope lol
"Feb 16, 2021, 10:53:03 PM",You know you're too used to running flats when 370 feet in elevation feels like a mountain.(not that I'm any better lol)
"Feb 17, 2021, 1:56:24 AM",Owen  Carter Yeah I saw lol
"Feb 18, 2021, 9:37:23 PM",Rip so you didn't see it blow up?
"Feb 18, 2021, 9:43:32 PM",Gosh darn siblings
"Feb 20, 2021, 6:38:18 PM",Ditto
"Feb 22, 2021, 10:40:35 PM",The .. at the end there had me thinking there was more lol
"Feb 27, 2021, 11:42:36 PM",Nice race!
"Feb 28, 2021, 10:52:30 PM",37 and pouring rain... I've run in worse but usually with others.
"Mar 1, 2021, 10:41:51 PM",My advice is to do some calf stretches against a wall so your shins don't get worse
"Mar 3, 2021, 9:46:45 PM",Lol I swear everything feels slower when you're doing it in a mask.
"Mar 3, 2021, 10:13:18 PM",Lol this was a workout so not exactly shooting for overall speed and yeah I guess I'm building back up but I need to add in my runs to practice and start doing more on the weekends
"Mar 4, 2021, 10:57:29 PM",Was the conversation about the optimal route for exiting the wrestling room?
"Mar 4, 2021, 10:57:57 PM",Nice core-on-a-bike
"Mar 5, 2021, 12:56:08 AM",Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I mean I could guess but *wink* *wink* has me scared
"Mar 7, 2021, 11:48:18 PM",I remember freaking out over 2 inches of water in middle school lol
"Mar 7, 2021, 11:59:24 PM",Hehe imagine going to a moderately large school
"Mar 8, 2021, 12:00:20 AM",Point taken Owen  Carter weren't we all

"Mar 11, 2021, 12:56:22 AM",Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
"Mar 13, 2021, 3:08:42 AM",I believe that one year ago today I told y'all I was moving.  Might have been last week idk lol.
"Mar 16, 2021, 11:30:43 PM",Noooo andrew
"Mar 18, 2021, 10:11:47 PM",Yup lol I thought abt just running outside but I think it's still good to do some rowing for my shin occasionally and it's easier when you're not alone and are dying with others
"Mar 18, 2021, 10:12:49 PM",That thing abt taking off layers and feeling faster is so true
"Mar 20, 2021, 9:47:19 PM",Geez that 5:58 is crazy
"Mar 20, 2021, 9:49:01 PM",PLANET KILLERRRRRRR (greenconsumerproject.org)
"Mar 25, 2021, 2:04:05 AM",Oof that's the worst feeling esp at the end of a workout
"Mar 25, 2021, 9:48:55 PM",Yummmm
"Mar 25, 2021, 10:15:42 PM",Impressive run? Anyway good job on all those segments.
"Mar 26, 2021, 12:25:08 AM",Geez gotta get those hurdle skillz
"Apr 2, 2021, 5:24:07 PM",Yeah I suppose lol because the last time I ran a mile officially was indoor with my 5:43:44 so...
"Apr 2, 2021, 5:36:14 PM",Longest walk niceeeeeeee
"Apr 2, 2021, 5:37:31 PM",Next u gotta go up the slopes on skis
"Apr 5, 2021, 9:25:37 PM",Man I miss these routes

"Apr 9, 2021, 2:24:46 AM",Owen  Carter if you want to feel like you crushed your two just look at mineeeeeeeeeee
"Apr 9, 2021, 4:00:10 AM","I personally guarantee that if you can go sub 5 in the mile you can go sub 2:20.  This is, however, coming from someone who has done neither and is basing this purely upon one 2:25 in practice on a gravel track."
"Apr 10, 2021, 11:36:14 PM",Uhhhhhhh I suppose a lot of ppl are driving now so idk shane
"Apr 11, 2021, 1:41:30 AM",oof thats gotta be complicated with insurance and stufff.  Is nick alright?
"Apr 11, 2021, 1:46:31 AM",Ya sucks for the other person bc they gonna have to pay all that
"Apr 12, 2021, 9:11:21 PM",lol tru but what you cant see are the like four or five times I stopped unnecessarily thinking I could clear up some ailement
"Apr 14, 2021, 9:12:48 PM",Oh the 46:46 yeah cool
"Apr 16, 2021, 3:36:55 AM",Indeed... Looking forward to coming back to Pittsburgh at some point and getting these
"Apr 17, 2021, 7:58:06 PM",Niceeee
"Apr 18, 2021, 10:25:19 PM",Lol now I understand why you like these shoes so much
"Apr 20, 2021, 2:02:20 AM",I've given up on my cadence at this point
"Apr 20, 2021, 2:10:12 AM",Wth
"Apr 20, 2021, 2:10:39 AM",Ayyyyyyy imagine being 16 couldn't be meeeeeee
"Apr 20, 2021, 2:11:43 AM",I have to say that this route looks mega fun
"Apr 20, 2021, 7:03:02 PM",I swear 300 pacing is impossible
"Apr 20, 2021, 11:20:42 PM",Owen  Carter nah ive run like 2:23 in practice but still havent run it in a meet lol
"Apr 21, 2021, 1:22:23 AM",Bruh idk how this is possible

"Apr 23, 2021, 9:17:20 PM","Phew I was worried u were becoming a hurdler... Or worse, a sprinter"
"May 1, 2021, 7:40:04 PM",Seems legit to me
"May 2, 2021, 3:09:56 AM",I may never understand how your splits are SO negative
"May 5, 2021, 8:58:03 PM",Eh not the time I wanted
"May 5, 2021, 8:59:01 PM",You guys have made it impossible for me to delete this 'run' in good faith lol
"May 5, 2021, 9:32:54 PM",Nope 11:15 my watch dosent like tracks.  Still like a 15 sec pr but not fast enough to secure a spot in leagues unless someone drops
"May 5, 2021, 9:53:22 PM",Yeah I know I can go faster but the weather was absolute crap nobody was happy with their times yesterday
"May 6, 2021, 9:15:11 PM",Among sus
"May 8, 2021, 2:54:58 AM",THIS IS SO CONSISTENT YOU MAY HAVE VIOLATED THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
"May 8, 2021, 3:00:57 PM",Dannng car show this weekend or smth?  
"May 8, 2021, 6:05:11 PM",Idk if u were there but do u remember that line of like 20 911s from like 2018 to like 1930
"May 9, 2021, 10:53:14 PM",Doug Farber uh oh... I don't want another unbeatable nccc-like segment... And thanks!

"May 11, 2021, 9:02:34 PM",Yeah I ply shouldn't have esp bc I didn't even look at it bc they have a clock for once

"May 15, 2021, 11:48:41 PM",Twas too easy
"May 18, 2021, 2:26:47 AM",U know it's bad when you don't expect a workout but u see coach has the five stopwatches
"May 19, 2021, 4:04:22 AM",Wth 6:00 is pushing it being safe lol
"Jun 3, 2021, 4:25:38 AM",Damn what a legend
"Jun 10, 2021, 9:03:48 PM",Me and my bike agree
"Jun 14, 2021, 1:57:46 PM",Lol I'm coming back to pgh soon so I've got just a lil bit longer than that till I see moul.
"Jun 14, 2021, 2:17:21 PM",I don't remember exactly I'll text that old gc with Jason and Andrew and Nick when we know more abt what we're doing.

"Jul 11, 2021, 3:46:45 PM",Okay at first I read this as windboro and then I realized it was wdinboro so now I'm wondering if it's a typo or if I'm just missing the pun or if I'm overthinking it.

"Sep 9, 2021, 12:00:31 AM","Reasonably, not the flattest of all year tho ply a bit worse than rwb"
"Sep 9, 2021, 12:09:08 AM",Yea the hills that are there are pretty quick and most ppl out here suck at hills so I pass them :)

"Jan 26, 2022, 11:01:06 PM",IKR ITS ONLY GETTING BETTER NEXT THING WE KNOW HE'LL BE USING A PACE MAP OR SOMETHING CRAZY
"Jan 27, 2022, 11:37:34 PM",Ikr I once did 13 on a bike at a 4:12 and it was rather hard I cannot imagine doing twice that on foot
"Jan 27, 2022, 11:38:15 PM",Some whacky wind patterns fr
"Feb 2, 2022, 3:04:19 AM",Sometimes when the run's surroundings feel boring the run itself must become an exciting workout to compensate
"Feb 3, 2022, 1:16:45 AM",hahaha no this was just ~3.1 by chance it was an 800 workout but pausing between the reps made the pace way low
"Feb 3, 2022, 1:19:25 AM",wrong turns >>> also 45min 5k not too shabby
"Feb 6, 2022, 3:08:13 AM",Tis simply because it is cold wearing a light mask might help u get used to it
"Feb 9, 2022, 12:37:49 AM",Best thing to do whilst on the mill
"Feb 9, 2022, 12:44:14 AM",Our pace and mileage is almost twinning today haha

"Aug 22, 2022, 12:16:39 PM",The segment CR in this run is impossible leading me to believe that the GPS messed up perhaps due to pausing while walking up the hill.  Thanks!!
"Aug 22, 2022, 12:23:50 PM",I gotta start doing me some stairs lol
"Aug 23, 2022, 3:03:34 AM",Monocots >>>

"Oct 24, 2022, 2:54:39 AM",R√∂mer-ing around?
"Oct 24, 2022, 11:03:18 PM","I lost my senior season to a stress fracture and though I'd largely achieved my goals it was still incredibly hard.  What I've learned gradually since is that running is so much more than any race or any season and we cannot let these things which happen and make us so angry and distraught define us.  The sport is bigger than anything we will ever achieve or hope to achieve in it and it will be with you as long as you're with it.  That being said, it will take a while to feel okay about what happens and that's okay, but know that running will always be with you."
"Oct 29, 2022, 5:42:30 PM",YOU WERE HERE????
"Nov 3, 2022, 10:17:32 PM",Yup

"Feb 26, 2023, 8:22:52 PM",It's georgus mmhmm üåû
"Mar 4, 2023, 9:07:27 PM",Thought that was our basement for a sec haha 
"Mar 4, 2023, 10:31:36 PM",Hmm could we combine the little trampoline and the treadmill? Maybe fix the tread slippage problem while we're at it
"Mar 7, 2023, 7:36:43 PM",I see you're turning into a UAA records pirate ü¶ú
"Mar 16, 2023, 10:16:17 PM",The Course record on this run(the segment up the hill with the 1:42min/mile pace) is a result of bad pausing on my part and is not real.  If it could be taken down so I don't have to take down the whole run that would be great.
"Mar 17, 2023, 6:48:27 PM",U might be able to get the life fitness app and connect it to the treadmill but the treadmill might be too old of a model can't tell
"Mar 17, 2023, 6:48:47 PM",Why do I waste brain space on life fitness treadmill models
"Mar 18, 2023, 5:36:47 PM",Awesome race man

"Mar 30, 2023, 9:48:22 PM","I got the kom for the schenley oval and counterclockwise segment, but only because my watch was paused for .1 of the segment."
"Apr 4, 2023, 1:06:25 PM",Lily E. Slog is a great word...
"Apr 4, 2023, 1:07:07 PM",Chris Milot I saw that haha I think he's actually a grad student at CMU! He has a quite interesting YouTube channel!

"Apr 30, 2023, 7:39:19 PM",You need Powerade to sponsor a drinking tray for biscuit
"May 4, 2023, 9:32:34 PM",Was the force with you?
"May 5, 2023, 3:09:18 AM",Maybe the fifth will be with you tomorrow...
"May 7, 2023, 9:25:39 PM",Yep! You also get pace and elevation and a few others - the elevation one looks kinda like a coffee stain though...
"May 8, 2023, 11:17:28 PM",Pace was a palindrome though pretty cool
"May 9, 2023, 7:42:40 PM",Indeed... I guess that makes tomorrow the ultimate pgh run lol

"Aug 16, 2023, 3:08:14 AM",Those are incredibly crisp ovals
"Sep 2, 2023, 3:14:08 AM",They built some more bridges
"Sep 15, 2023, 3:03:34 PM",Thats rather embarrassing haha - i guess my run brain had directions backwards.  Thanks though!
"Sep 27, 2023, 8:45:51 PM",Hmm I actually recognize a route you ran! This aint Georgia!
"Sep 27, 2023, 8:46:29 PM",That hill is really bad but little freemansburg town is worth it
"Oct 17, 2023, 2:41:29 AM",I don't think they realize they got the segment -- but they even said it was their drive to target... They could crop the activity!!!
"Oct 22, 2023, 1:59:41 AM",ü§ù

"Nov 23, 2023, 7:10:43 PM",Macy's day thanksgiving parade?
"Dec 3, 2023, 1:10:18 PM",I've always wondered about doing this but been unwilling to feel like crap after an all nighter.  Way to go man that's crazy
"Dec 12, 2023, 12:29:51 AM",How did both of us randomly choose today out of all days to rock climb 
"Dec 17, 2023, 4:56:12 PM",I was being chased by the ghost of Christmases past(also caffeine helps)
"Dec 17, 2023, 9:41:45 PM",This is farrrrr more impressive than my run...
