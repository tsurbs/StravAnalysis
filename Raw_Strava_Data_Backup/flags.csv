Bad GPS data,Activity,7675338343,The segment CR in this run is impossible leading me to believe that the GPS messed up perhaps due to pausing while walking up the hill.  Thanks!!,"Aug 22, 2022, 12:16:36 PM"
Bad GPS data,Activity,8726577156,The Course record on this run(the segment up the hill with the 1:42min/mile pace) is a result of bad pausing on my part and is not real.  If it could be taken down so I don't have to take down the whole run that would be great.,"Mar 16, 2023, 10:16:16 PM"
