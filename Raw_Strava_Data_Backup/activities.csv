Yesterday, after my run, I spend a bunch of time trying to get the general soreness out of my legs because I didn't want to be sore for the 5k time trial today. I got most of the sorness and tightness out, but there was a particularly bad knot in my hamstring that I couldn't get out.  I got it to a reasonably comfortable point, but when I woke up today, it had gotten a bit worse.  By the time practice rolled around today, I was feeling the knot even when I was walking, so I decided to tell my coach and ask if he had any ideas for stretches for me to do.  Instead of giving me stretches, he told me not to do the *2 mile* time trial and to instead see the trainer.  I told him that it really wasn't too bad, but he insisted.  I went to the trainer and they said that I was lucky I came this early and they gave me some stretches and told me to take tommorow easy and Sunday off, which is REALLY UNFORTUNATE because I haven't missed a long run in forever and also because I didn't get to do the time trial and also because I've never been injured before and day 1 sucked.

Idk what happened with my watch but this course is actually 3.1 and coach had my 2nd mile at 6:00 and somebody collapsed so he didn't get the finish but ik I picked it up so my watch's 18:07 makes sense.  I'm happy with this bc it's a solid 5s PR on a crappy course on a crappier day in blunt spikes and with no competition.  Looking forward to the first race on Friday.

Who decided we would have to run up it twice, idk that takes a special kind of person.

Also I tried to get the butz to chester segment and Strava says I did it at 6:02 which is just wrong bc a) it felt faster than that and b) that mile was 6:02 average and ik for a fact that I wasn't running that fast for the first half of that mile. Not a super big deal tho.  Also I saw a whacky grey fox/shorthaired dog/cat/coyote and paused my watch so I didn't get eaten and I forgot to unpause it for a lil bit but I don't think that made a huge difference.

Second mile was where I really held it together and I made up key ground for the third mile where I passed both of our main competition (weatherly's) top runners to get fifth.  I held on the rest of the third mile and DIDNT PASS OUT YAY. Forgot to pause my watch which is why the time is wrong.

I knew immediately I was going bc I was fifth but we weren't sure about the rest of the team because our plan of how to beat weatherly had gone awry.  As we were cheering on the girls I heard one of my teammates say guys we made it and it was just insane.  We got first in the district(beating weatherly who beat us last year) and I got fifth and as an added bonus beat all the weatherly kids.

I went out with like the second pack of ppl and felt good and then I looked at my watch and it said 6:00 but I assumed it was a mistake so I asked the guy next to me and he said 6:00 too so I just shrugged and went with it(I was not fully awake) I picked off a couple people who were going slow up the only hill on the course.  I ran on my own like this for a bit until ~mile 2 and then the guy who is listed as having done this run with me on Strava caught up and we traded places for a while and then the and the 6:00 guy also caught up and they were both in front of me. Right after mile 3 I pushed and caught up to both of them and the three of us ran together for most of it and then around mile 7 I picked it up and went ahead(or the other guys dropped back not sure) it was harder running on my own but I kept it up until like mile 10 when I started feeling really bad for the first time and soon after that the guys I was running with earlier caught up and after a bit of an attempt to keep up on my part I fell back.  My last two were much slower and felt that way.  I ended in 1:21:45 and got sixth overall and first in my age group so I got the pictured trophy.

6561190219,"Jan 21, 2022, 9:20:24 PM",A rather embarrassing tale,Elliptical,"So I found a new hill right.  I was all excited I was gonna do a hill workout on it and get the segment and it's like 20% steeper than my normal hill and way longer, everything was good to go I was looking forward to the workout all through my chem midterm and then I was walking home after the midterm and boom I slip on some invisible ice and fall somewhat hard.  Initially the worst pain is my knee but that fades.  Then it's my hand, but that too fades.  Then I realize that my left foot right over the big toe bone in the foot is hurting like a lot.  So naturally I ice it once I realize it's a problem which is like an hour after I fell, but an hour later it's barely better.  I think about running on it and it seems like a horrible idea but the support of my shoes actually helps a lot but I try running and it still is too painful so I rule that out.  Biking also hurts it so thats out too.  Eventually I come to the conclusion that the best thing for it is the elliptical at school, so I walk back and run and that is this run.  Elliptical is werid, so I would recommend salting the sidewalk around your house if that applies to you so you don't have to ever deal with the embarrassment that is running on an eliptical.  Anywho we'll see how it's looking tomorrow but I really don't want to ever have to do that again.",2400,0,,,false,,,,,,2400.0,2400.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,media/624c4379-7fb1-4adf-85b9-e042bc62bda4.jpg

I was expecting the temp change but not the snow, so when I woke up I was already a little nervous abt that.  I got to the race and the roads were not super snowy which was good I guess but then I got out and proceeded to slip down the hill to the start/bib pickup.  This made me even more stressed.  Warmup was no better, I basically couldn't beat 6:00 pace at all bc it was just too slidey.  The race itself was more of the same, just kinda taking the conditions as they came and hoping I didn't get lost on the course.

It's been 13 years and it's said so often it's practically a cliche but  I could not have imagined who I am today back in kindergarten when I started this or even four mere months ago.  I remember I had a kind of existentialist phase in second grade and in the recess line one day I was thinking about graduation and it felt impossible and now it's right here literally less than 12 hrs away it still feels just as impossible.  It's been absolutely unreal going from elementary to middle school, finding friends there and then leaving them 5 short years later for a new place across the state.  But then there's the past two-and-a-bit years which have been sooo crazy pushing myself and finding myself and finding others and ultimately an awesome group of people who are literally more amazing friends than I could have asked for.  There's a lot about moving on this weekend but what truly scares me the most is that I'll never be able to top this -- that I'll never find what I have here again.  And I have to remind myself then of two things.  1) these friends, this environment will never truly be gone.  We'll always be there.  2) there are sooo many more people out there literally greater than the number of people I've had the outstanding fortune to meet over the past two years by orders of magnitude just at my college. And(and I hate starting sentences with and but let's be real nobody's reading this anyway) so all this means is that I gotta enjoy the time I've got left with these amazing individuals and in these amazing groups that have formed largely over the past year.  So probably no ride tomorrow but that's for good reason.  Anyway thanks for coming to my (terrible) graduation speech this is all so unreal I just can't damnit. 

I hope I remain so fortunate to not recognize myself in four more years and four after that.  This volatility keeps you alive.

I also had some issues with pausing/unpausing my watch and one of them happened to be up a segment which is a hill so I unfairly got the CR for it, but I flagged it so hopefully they'll take it down but if anyone else wants to flag it to get it more attention that would be great.  I don't feel too bad about it though because looks like the rest of the times are likely glitched too.  Additionally, my poor pausing means the reported distance is significantly shorter than the actual distance, as when I do the strava ""correct distance"" it shows up as 9.15mi, but when I do the correct distance, it makes my pace way too fast so i think the best course of action is just to add a .5 mile manual entry at the average pace for this run.

I did a workout today but really it was more of a sociology trip than anything because with nothing constantly pressing to do to give my brain a sense of feeling accomplished I was examining what is really important in life and specifically a subset of those things being things that make life FEEL like it's important and so of course running through the CMU campus I start thinking about doing great things with my life and about how I should persue this project or that project that I think is something I personally could do to make the world better, but then halfway between campus and schenley I run into this statue of a colonel in the army in the 19thC with a moustache that looked like Theodore Roosevelt might call at some point to get it back and I start wondering why it's there so I stop and read it and it talks about his service in the army and the wars he fought in and when he ""mustered"" and all sorts of things and don't get me wrong it's all very impressive and not something I'd wanna do myself but at the same time it's like might a statue commemorating all the people who gave their lives fighting under this dude(who himself died of ""disease"" in 1899) so this has me wondering what society values as important because it obviously seems out of touch with what I value as important but then I think about my own assessment back on campus of what makes life important and I wonder if that's the same thing I would say makes someone else's life important? And then I think about if someone like Mark Zuckerberg would get his statue somewhere once he dies and I don't really think he would because that's just not the modern style so then I'm wondering if maybe I wouldn't give my ideal self a statue because that's vain and what are statues even like why does anyone get a statue.  Anywho I get to schenley and there are hordes of people of all ages playing sports and running and walking and sitting and it makes me think of a different subset of the important things in life being those that make it happy because ultimately nobody who is at schenley has to be there like every person there got up and went there and they did that for some reason whether they're motivated by a friend group or by self-care they are there and they're happy because if they weren't happy they wouldn't be there(such is the beauty of choices).  So anyway I did some 800 reps, watched two dogs tussle for like 15 mins, did another 800, petted one of the dogs, and went back just as confused about the important things in life as I was before but maybe just maybe slightly happier having attempted to understand it.",2626,6.73,192.0,26,false,,Pearly Whites,activities/9694620392.tcx.gz,,,2626.0,1744.0,6730.2978515625,6.9031596183776855,3.8591158390045166,13.493611335754395,51.193599700927734,272.6000061035156,321.20001220703125,6.206529140472412,-0.5601534843444824,,,,,,152.64039611816406,,,597.9642944335938,,,26.0,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,6705.7998046875,1683583232.0,3.0,21.90999984741211,21.469999313354492,11.5,0.5199999809265137,1011.2000122070312,2.450000047683716,4.820000171661377,335.0,0.0,1683540608.0,1683591808.0,0.625,,13173387.0,0.4399999976158142,5.0,0.8199999928474426,27675.4296875,1.0,,,,,0.0,2.5629467964172363,4439.5,,,,,""

JK I wish it was that easy so someone was late for my flight and rather than do the normal thing and just accept it they decided that if they can't go then none of the rest of us should so they made some thread about WMDs on the plane and deplaned us for like 5 hours in which we were constantly 30 mins away from boarding and finally after they searched everyone's luggage we got back on the plane and everyone clapped and it was very wholesome.  Although I missed my connecting bus my parents got me and I got in like 12:30 last night.  Feels bad for.all the people flying internationally though like a bunch of ppl were flying to London or doha and were gonna miss their flights.  Anyway I'm back and still recovering from that and my poor airport nutrition yesterday so should be faster tomorrow.

10246873017,"Nov 19, 2023, 1:48:03 PM",Trying out north side,Run,"Chill long run, wasn't trying to go fast because I'm still sore from Friday and it's a new route.  Nonetheless I tried to pick it up a bit along the jail trail but my stomach wasn't having it. And then I totally hit an energy wall when I got to panther hollow(apparently a single banana is not enough to sustain me for 13 miles 🤷🏼‍♂️). Stopped at Scottys market and got my normal Gatorade and protein drink thing as well as a donut and that donut made me feel way better which is why the last half mile is speedy.

Happy with the negative split and overall pace though.　


Also the tree at the point is ugly...

Looking forward to developing my speed with these stronger hamstrings.  Some icy bits but no.real issues.
